                    <p>I'm a first year undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering. I grew up in Seoul, South Korea. After graduating from high school, I entered Computer Education at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea. At Sungkyunkwan University, I learned various computer knowledge by combining computer science and education. However, I wanted to major in mechanical engineering because I got interested in robots while attending the university. Therefore, I transferred to University at Buffalo in 2020 because I wanted to have various experiences in the U.S. and to change my major to Mechanical Engineering.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy 3D modeling using Adobe inventor. I made various products by modeling my own needs in real life. Some of them can be found in this portfolio. I printed out products that I designed in 3D by myself with 3D printer. These activities will help me make robots later.</p>
                        
                    <p>Also, I have been preparing to join a team with students at UB to participate in the drone competition since the fall semester of 2020. My group is discussing and studying what drones are, how they are made, and what the current problem is. The drone competition will be held in the spring semester of 2021, and I will study harder to achieve good results.</p>
                        
                    <p>I am super excited to continue my journey here at the University at Buffalo, and to be a part of the Mechanical Engineering Department.</p>
